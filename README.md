# FindingFalcone

# Problem Context 
Our problem is set in the planet of Lengaburu, in the distant
distant galaxy of Tara B. After the recent war with neighbouring
planet Falicornia, King Shan has exiled the Queen of Falicornia
for 15 years.

Queen Al Falcone is now in hiding. But if King Shan can find
her before the years are up, she will be exiled for another 15
yearsâ€¦.

# Problem: Finding Falcone
King Shan has received intelligence that Al Falcone is in hiding in one of these 6 planets - DonLon, Enchai, Jebing,
Sapir, Lerbin & Pingasor. However he has limited resources at his disposal & can send his army to only 4 of these
planets.

The coding problem is to help King Shan find Al Falcone.
